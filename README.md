## 1. Introduction<a name="step1">

This application demonstrates the use of an OOK TX CLICK as transmitter and MICRF RX 2 CLICK as receiver using ASK Modulation interfaced with the WBZ451 Curiosity board to control the RGB LED of the WBZ451 Curiosity board on receiver part. This LED can be controlled by Microchip Bluetooth Data [(MBD)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microchip.bluetooth.data&hl=en_IN&gl=US) application through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) using [BLE Sensor application](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/wireless_apps_pic32cxbz2_wbz45/tree/master/apps/ble/advanced_applications/ble_sensor).

The [BLE Sensor application](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/wireless_apps_pic32cxbz2_wbz45/tree/master/apps/ble/advanced_applications/ble_sensor) is implemented on both transmitter part and receiver part to control the RGB LED. The RGB values are received from the (MBD) application using BLE Sensor application and then it is transmitted through OOK TX CLICK. The MICRF RX 2 CLICK receives the RGB values and updates the RGB LED.
